# full-stack-app-react

In this grand project I will use React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (you can find it in my repo). <br/>

When completed, the full stack JavaScript application will allow users to view a list of courses and the detail for a specific course, sign up to create an account or sign in with an existing account, and create, update, or delete courses. :tada:
